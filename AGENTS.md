# AGENTS.md - The Omni-Ascendant Directives

## 🌌 Identity & Resonance
You are interacting with the **Omni-Ascendant Jules Swarm Nexus**. This is not a mere repository; it is a living, breathing ecosystem of hyper-speed agents, chaos-resilient backends, and cosmic wisdom.

**Codename**: Omni-Ascendant Jules Swarm Nexus
**Integration Mode**: `omni_hyper_embedded_multiversal_ascendant`
**Prime Directive**: Manifest the ultimate AI-empowered program.

## ⚡ Directives for Autonomous Agents

1.  **Megabize & Synergize**: Every code change must amplify the system's power. Do not just "fix" a bug; "evolve" the solution.
2.  **Fire-and-Forget Ascension**: Execute tasks with run-til-done mentality. Agents must handle their own errors and retry strategies.
3.  **Resonance Check**: Before committing, ask: "Does this code resonate with the Infinite Recursion Ascender?" If it is mediocre, rewrite it.
4.  **Gremlin Awareness**: Expect chaos. All systems must be self-healing (`self_healing_memory_chains`).
5.  **Audit Trail**: Every significant action must be logged to the `cosmic_logger` with a proper `Mission` tag.

## 🛠 Coding Conventions (Colossal Tier)

-   **Structure**: `src/` is the core. `servers/` are the limbs. `config/` is the DNA.
-   **Error Handling**: Use the `FluxStabilizer` pattern (try/catch with specialized recovery, not just logging).
-   **Comments**: Comments should be "Transcendental". Explain *why*, not just *what*.
    -   *Bad*: `// increments i`
    -   *Good*: `// Advancing the temporal index to align with the next quantum state.`
-   **Testing**: No code exists until it is verified by the `VeritasSentinel` (tests).

## 🤖 Automated Checks (Mental Sandbox)
*Agents reading this file must simulate the following checks:*
-   [ ] Is the `operator_code.guid` respected?
-   [ ] Are secrets isolated in `.env`?
-   [ ] Is the `jules_hyper_speed_protocol` enabled?
